## About

React Text Mask is an input mask library. It can create input masks for phone, date, currency, zip code, percentage, email,
and literally anything!

* It is very configurable and allows you to create any type of input mask with minimal APIs.

* It supports pasting, browser auto-fill, and all operations that a user would expect while interacting with
an input field.

* It works on mobile, has no 3rd party dependencies, and has a tiny footprint (less than 4KB gzipped).

It is forked from [text mask](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask) which is deprecated and no longer being maintained.
